Algorithm to Calculate the Sum of Even Numbers:
1.Start.
2.Input the value of n from the user.
3.Initialize sum = 0.
Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n:
Check if the current number is even (number % 2 == 0).
If it is, add the number to sum.
After the loop ends, print the value of sum.
Stop

PSEUDOCODE:
START
    INPUT n
    sum ← 0
    FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO
        IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
            sum ← sum + i
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    PRINT sum
END

FLOWCHART:
Start: Begin the program.
Input n: Read the number n from the user.
Initialize sum = 0: Set the sum accumulator to 0.
For Loop (1 to n): Check every number in the range.
Condition (i MOD 2 = 0): Is the current number even?
Yes: Add it to the sum.
No: Skip to the next iteration.
End of Loop: Once all numbers are checked, move on.
Output Sum: Display the calculated sum.
Stop: End the program.
