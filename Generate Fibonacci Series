Algorithm to Generate Fibonacci Series
1.Start.
2.Input the number of terms .
3.Initialize two variables:
4.a = 0 (first term)
5.b = 1 (second term)
6.Print a and b
7.Repeat for n -  2 times (since a and b are already printed):
8.Calculate the next term as next = a+ b.
9.Print next
10.Update a = b and b = next
11.Stop.

PSEUDOCODE:
START
    INPUT n
    a ← 0
    b ← 1
    PRINT a
    PRINT b
    FOR i FROM 3 TO n DO
        next ← a + b
        PRINT next
        a ← b
        b ← next
    ENDFOR
END

FLOWCHART:
A[Start] --> B[Input n]
    B --> C[Set a = 0, b = 1]
    C --> D[Print a and b]
    D --> E[Set i = 3]
    E --> F{Is i ≤ n?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Calculate next = a + b]
    G --> H[Print next]
    H --> I[Set a = b, b = next]
    I --> J[Increment i by 1]
    J --> F
    F -->|No| K[Stop]
