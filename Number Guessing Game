Algorithm for Number Guessing Game
1.Start.
2.Generate a random number secret_number between 1 and 100.
3.Initialize guess = -1 and attempts = 0
4.While guess isn't equal to secret_number:
5.Input guess from the user
6.Increment attempts by 1
7.If guess <secret_number, print "Higher".
8.Else if guess> secret_number, print "Lower".
9.Else, print "Correct! you guessed it in attempts."
10.Stop.

PSEUDOCODE:
START
    secret_number ← RANDOM(1, 100)
    guess ← -1
    attempts ← 0

    WHILE guess ≠ secret_number DO
        INPUT guess
        attempts ← attempts + 1
        IF guess < secret_number THEN
            PRINT "Higher"
        ELSE IF guess > secret_number THEN
            PRINT "Lower"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Correct! You guessed it in", attempts, "attempts."
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
END

FLOWCHART:
A[Start] --> B[Generate secret_number (1-100)]
    B --> C[Initialize guess = -1, attempts = 0]
    C --> D{Is guess = secret_number?}
    D -->|No| E[Input guess]
    E --> F[Increment attempts by 1]
    F --> G{Is guess < secret_number?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Print "Higher"]
    H --> D
    G -->|No| I{Is guess > secret_number?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Print "Lower"]
    J --> D
    I -->|No| K[Print "Correct! Attempts = attempts"]
    K --> L[Stop]
    D -->|Yes| K
